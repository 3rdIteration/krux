From the spec: Every public key can be prefixed by an 8-character hexadecimal fingerprint plus optional derivation steps (hardened and unhardened) surrounded by brackets, identifying the master and derivation path the key or xpub that follows was derived with. However, in practice not all wallet software supports this extended format, so Krux still provides a zpub as a fallback. For more information, check out https://outputdescriptors.org/ . Why am I unable to sign a PSBT from BlueWallet? \u00b6 As mentioned above, some wallet software does not support the descriptor key expression format. In this case, BlueWallet will ignore the key origin and derivation info when importing the xpub to create a single-key wallet. This will result in the wrong derivation being used in BlueWallet and thus the inability to sign an outbound transaction in Krux. Currently, the way to properly create a single-key wallet in BlueWallet is to export the second QR code that Krux displays which contains the zpub. BlueWallet can then correctly infer the derivation path when creating the wallet. Why isn't Krux scanning my QR code? \u00b6 The level of detail that you see is what Krux sees. If the QR code shown on the device's screen is blurry, the camera lens of the device may be out of focus. It can be adjusted by rotating it (with your fingertip) clockwise or counter-clockwise to achieve a clearer result. If you have adjusted the lens already, the device may be too far away or too close to the code to read it. Start by holding the device as close to the QR code as possible and pulling away slowly until all or most of the QR code is viewable within the screen. If the code on the screen looks crisp, Krux should read it quickly and give you immediate feedback. If you are in a dark setting, you can hold down the front button of the M5StickV to turn on its LED light to potentially increase visibility. Why am I getting an error when I try to scan a QR code? \u00b6 If Krux is recognizing that it sees a QR code but is displaying an error message after reading it, the likely reason is that the QR code is not in a format that Krux understands. For mnemonics, Krux recognizes: BIP-39 Plaintext (Used by Krux and https://iancoleman.io/bip39/ ) SeedSigner SeedQR and CompactSeedQR Formats UR Type crypto-bip39 For loading wallets, Krux recognizes: JSON with at least a descriptor key containing an output descriptor string Key-value INI files with at least Format , Policy , and Derivation keys UR Type crypto-output For PSBTs, Krux recognizes: Base43, Base58, and Base64-encoded bytes Raw Bytes UR Type crypto-psbt Additionally, Krux recognizes animated QR codes that use either the plaintext pMofN or binary UR encodings. Why can't my computer read the QR code that Krux displays? \u00b6 If you are using an M5StickV, the small screen makes it difficult for laptop webcams to capture enough detail to parse the QR codes it displays. In the future, more work will be done to support displaying lower density QR codes. For now, a workaround you can do is to take a picture or video of the QR code with a better-quality camera (such as your phone), then enlarge and display the photo or video to your webcam.

Because true entropy is difficult to produce, especially with an embedded device, Krux outsources entropy generation to the user. Dice Rolls \u00b6 At the start screen, once you select New Mnemonic , you will be taken to a second menu where you can choose to create a mnemonic via rolls of a D6 (standard six-sided die) or D20 (20-sided die). The number of dice rolls you choose determines the amount of words in the final mnemonic. Via D6 \u00b6 The entropy in a single roll of a D6 is 2.585 bits ( log 2 (6) ); therefore 50 rolls will result in 128 bits of entropy, enough to generate a 12-word mnemonic. Doubling the amount of rolls doubles the entropy to 256 bits, resulting in a 24-word mnemonic. Via D20 \u00b6 Since a D20 has more possible outcomes, the entropy is increased per roll to 4.322 bits ( log 2 (20) ). This means that only 30 rolls are necessary to create a 12-word mnemonic and 60 rolls for a 24-word mnemonic. How it works \u00b6 Krux keeps track of every roll you enter and displays the cumulative string of outcomes after each roll. When you have entered your final roll, Krux will hash this string using SHA256 and output the resulting hash to the screen so that you can verify it for yourself. Krux then takes this hash, runs unhexlify on it to encode it as bytes, and deterministically converts it into a mnemonic according to the BIP-39 Reference Implementation . Note: For 12-word mnemonics, only the first half of the SHA256 hash is used (128 bits), while 24-word mnemonics use the full hash (256 bits). Alternatives \u00b6 See here for a good method to generate a mnemonic manually, or visit Ian Coleman's BIP-39 Tool offline or on an airgapped device to generate one automatically. It's worth noting that Ian's tool is able to take a mnemonic and generate a QR code that Krux can read in via the QR input method mentioned on the next page.","title":"Generating a Mnemonic"},{"location":"getting-started/generating-a-mnemonic/#dice-rolls","text":"At the start screen, once you select New Mnemonic , you will be taken to a second menu where you can choose to create a mnemonic via rolls of a D6 (standard six-sided die) or D20 (20-sided die).

Consult the part list for more information. If you wish to perform airgapped firmware updates or want persistent settings, you will also need a supported microSD card . Software \u00b6 You will need a computer with git and vagrant installed. Fetch the code \u00b6 In a terminal, run the following: git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/selfcustody/krux This will pull down the Krux source code as well as the code for all its dependencies and put them inside a new krux folder. Note: When you wish to pull down updates to this repo, you can run the following inside the krux folder: git pull origin main && git submodule update --init --recursive Spin up a virtual machine \u00b6 After you have installed Vagrant, run the following inside the krux folder to spin up a new VM: vagrant up Build the firmware \u00b6 Prerequisite for upgrading via microSD \u00b6 If you wish to perform airgapped upgrades via microSD card, you will need to have a private and public key pair to sign your builds and verify the signatures. You can use an existing Krux installation and mnemonic to sign your builds with, or you can generate a keypair and sign from the openssl CLI . Commands have been added to the krux shell script to make this easier. In either case, you will need to update the SIGNER_PUBKEY field in src/krux/metadata.py to store your public key so that Krux can verify future builds before installing. To generate a keypair, run: vagrant ssh -c 'cd /vagrant; ./krux generate-keypair' vagrant ssh -c 'cd /vagrant; ./krux pem-to-pubkey pubkey.pem' The first command will create privkey.pem and pubkey.pem files you can use with openssl, and the second command will output your public key in the form expected by Krux. Once you've updated the SIGNER_PUBKEY with this value, you can proceed with the regular build process. Build \u00b6 Run the following, replacing DEVICE with either m5stickv , amigo_tft , amigo_ips , dock , or bit : vagrant ssh -c 'cd /vagrant; ./krux build maixpy_DEVICE' This will take around an hour or so to complete the first time. Subsequent builds should take only a few minutes. If all goes well, you should see a new build folder containing firmware.bin and kboot.kfpkg files when the build completes. Flash the firmware onto the device \u00b6 Connect the device to your computer via USB, power it on, and run the following: vagrant ssh -c 'cd /vagrant; ./krux flash' Note: Running vagrant reload prior to flashing may be necessary in order for the newly-inserted USB device to be detected and passed through to the VM on startup. If this command fails, even after reloading, with the error Failed to find device via USB. Is it connected and powered on? , make sure that your user has been added to the vboxusers group. On Mac or Linux, run the following command: sudo usermod -a -G vboxusers yourusername If the flashing process fails midway through, check the connection, restart the device, and try the command again. When the flashing process completes, you should see the Krux logo: If after 30 seconds you still see a black screen, try power cycling the device by holding down the power button for six seconds. Congrats, you're now running Krux! A note about the Amigo \u00b6 Some Amigo screens have inverted x coordinates while others don\u2019t. If after flashing maixpy_amigo_tft to your device you notice that the buttons on keypad input screens appear to be in the wrong order, please try flashing maixpy_amigo_ips instead (or vice versa) which should correct the issue. Multilingual support \u00b6 Prefer a different language? Krux has support for multiple languages. Once at the start screen, go to Settings , followed by Locale , and select the locale you wish to use. If you have a microSD card inserted into the device, your preference will be automatically saved to a settings.json file at the root of the card. Upgrade via microSD card \u00b6 Once you've installed the initial firmware on your device via USB, you can either continue updating the device by flashing or you can perform upgrades via microSD card to keep the device airgapped. After you've built the firmware, you can sign it using one of the following methods. Method 1: Signing from Krux \u00b6 First, calculate the SHA256 hash of the new firmware by running: vagrant ssh -c 'cd /vagrant; ./krux sha256 build/firmware.bin' Copy this hex string and turn it into a QR code using whichever QR code generator you'd like. In Krux, enter the mnemonic of your private key that will be used for signing, and go to Sign > Message . Scan the QR code you generated, and you will be asked if you wish to sign the hash. Proceed, and you will be presented with a base64-encoded string containing the signature, as text and as a QR code. Take this string and create a signature file by running: vagrant ssh -c 'cd /vagrant; ./krux b64decode \"signature-in-base64\" > build/firmware.bin.sig' This will generate a firmware.bin.sig file containing a signature of the firmware's SHA256 hash. Method 2: Signing from your computer with OpenSSL \u00b6 With the keypair you generated before , you can now run: vagrant ssh -c 'cd /vagrant; ./krux sign build/firmware.bin privkey.pem' This will generate a firmware.bin.sig file containing a signature of the firmware's SHA256 hash. Upgrade via microSD card (continued) \u00b6 To perform an upgrade, simply copy the firmware.bin and firmware.bin.sig files to the root of a FAT-32 formatted microSD card, insert the card into your device, and reboot the device. If it detects the new firmware file and is able to verify the signature, you will be prompted to install it. Once installation is complete, eject the microSD card and delete the firmware files before reinserting and rebooting.","title":"Installing from source"},{"location":"getting-started/installing-from-source/#requirements","text":"","title":"Requirements"},{"location":"getting-started/installing-from-source/#hardware","text":"You will need a K210-based device such as the M5StickV, Maix Amigo, Maix Dock, or Maix Bit and a USB-C cable to continue.
