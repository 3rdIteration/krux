This option allows you to remove any stored encrypted mnemonic from the device's internal memory or an SD card. For more information, see [Krux Encrypted Mnemonics](./encrypted-mnemonics.md).

When mnemonics are removed from the device's flash memory, Krux will no longer be able to access them. However, as with most operating systems, the data may still be recoverable using specialized tools. If you stored any important keys with a weak encryption key, it is recommended to use the "Wipe Device" feature below to ensure that the data is irrecoverable.

When mnemonics are removed from an SD card, Krux will overwrite the region where the encrypted mnemonic was stored with empty data. This makes it more secure to delete mnemonics from SD cards using Krux rather than a PC or another device. However, Krux does not have a "Wipe" feature for SD cards; you can find this feature in third-party applications.

This option permanently removes all stored encrypted mnemonics and settings from the device's internal flash memory. It ensures that the data is irrecoverable, making it an adequate measure to take if any important mnemonics were stored with a weak encryption key.
