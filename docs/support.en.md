## Ways you can help
### Development
Audit the code, file an issue, make a pull request, or do all three. :)

### Documentation
I'd like to see Krux help as many people as possible, and to do that, good documentation is needed. If you identify a better way to say something, please make a PR, any help is appreciated.

### Translation
Krux supports different languages. If you missed a language or saw a awkward translation, open an issue or make a PR! You can also make a difference by translating this documentation!

### Social
Reach out our [Telegram group](https://t.me/SC_Krux) or [X profile](https://twitter.com/selfcustodykrux) for faster help, share ideas and join the Krux community.
Help others get to know Krux.

### Donations
Krux won't ask for, receive, manage or distribute donations. You can donate directly to a Krux contributor of your choice.

Thank you!
